## Project 1: Research Project: Ensemble Learning for Crop Disease Detection
Description: This research project focused on leveraging ensemble modeling techniques to improve crop disease detection. By utilizing a dataset provided by BioScout containing labeled images of rust spores, we embarked on a journey to explore various ensemble methodologies. Our objective was to strike an optimal balance between model performance and efficiency. Through meticulous data preprocessing, model implementation, and rigorous evaluation, we aimed to provide insights and recommendations for enhancing disease detection in agriculture. This project underscores the importance of leveraging advanced machine learning techniques for precision farming and sustainable agricultural practices.

## Project 2: Biometric facial recognition system
Description: This project involves facial recognition using the Olivetti Faces dataset. 
This project essentially showcases the process of facial recognition using machine learning techniques, from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation. It also demonstrates techniques like PCA for dimensionality reduction and cross-validation for model validation.

## Project 3: Chest-Xray-Pneumonia-Prediction
Description: In this project, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is developed to classify chest X-ray images into two categories: 'Normal' and 'Pneumonia'. The dataset used for training and testing consists of chest X-ray images obtained from the Chest X-ray Pneumonia dataset. Overall, this project demonstrates the use of CNNs for automated classification of chest X-ray images, which could potentially assist medical professionals in diagnosing pneumonia more efficiently.

## Project 4: Image Denoising with Autoencoders
Description: In this project, I implemented various types of autoencoders using TensorFlow and Keras to perform image denoising tasks on the MNIST dataset.  
This project showcases the versatility of autoencoders in various image processing tasks, from simple compression and reconstruction to more sophisticated applications like denoising.

## Project 5: Watermarking and Steganography
Description: This project focused on steganalysis, which is the detection of hidden messages within digital media such as images.  
The project involves extracting features from cover and stego images using a derivative filter and then training a linear classifier to differentiate between them.
